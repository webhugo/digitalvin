<p>You might have seen a recent tweet from Elon Musk suggesting that finding duplicate Social Security Numbers in a government database is a clear sign of "massive fraud."</p>

<figure ><div >
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just learned that the social security database is not de-duplicated, meaning you can have the same SSN many times over, which further enables MASSIVE FRAUD!!

Your tax dollars are being stolen. <a href="https://t.co/hSZdNY4wxf">https://t.co/hSZdNY4wxf</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1888484555092312466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And let's be honest, at first glance, that <em>sounds</em> pretty bad, right? If you're picturing a big Excel spreadsheet, you'd think every person should only be listed <em>once</em>.</p>

<p>But here's the thing&#8230; a giant government database is <em>not</em> an Excel spreadsheet. (Who's gonna tell him? Probably many already have.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Let's say the government pays a Social Security recipient in July.</p>

<p>A record of that payment goes into the database, tagged with their SSN.</p>

<p>Then August rolls around. They get paid again. Another record of <em>that</em> payment goes into the database, tagged with the <em>same</em> SSN.</p>

<p>Look at that! We now have duplicate SSNs. Is it a massive fraud ring? Nope. It's just&#8230; Tuesday. Or, you know, a record of two separate payments made to the exact same person.</p>

<hr />

### Our "Cutting-Edge" Tech (That's Decades Old)

<p>This is where all the data pros roll their eyes, because we've had this <em>wild, cutting-edge technology</em> to handle this for ages. It's called SQL.</p>

<p>When data analysts (and yes, plot twist, government employees who use SQL <em>do</em> exist) want a list of <em>people</em>, not <em>payments</em>, they don't just hit "Control+F."</p>

<p>They just ask the database, "Hey, can you show me only the <em>unique</em> SSNs?" And <em>poof!</em> The database filters out all the payment records and just gives them a clean list of individuals.</p>

<p>And look, even Excel can do this! Not that I would <em>ever</em> recommend storing the entire country's personal data in a single Excel spreadsheet on a desktop.</p>

<p>(Seriously, please don't do that. They're not doing that&#8230; right? ðŸ¤¨)</p>

<p>So, next time you see "duplicates" in a database, remember it's probably not fraud. It's just a logbook.</p>
